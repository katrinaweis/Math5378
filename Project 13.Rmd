import the dataset
```{r}
regression1<-read.csv("Regression.csv")
```

use the linear model (lm) command to create the model we'll work with and call the model
```{r}
fit<- lm(regression1$ROLL ~ regression1$UNEM + regression1$HGRAD + regression1$INC, data = regression1)
fit
```

Predict the enrollment if the unemployment rate = 4.1%, HGrad = 17231, Inc = 3000
```{r}
unem = 4.1
hgrad = 17231
inc = 3000
Enrollment = -9153.2545 + unem*450.1245 + hgrad*0.4065 + inc*4.2749
Enrollment
```
